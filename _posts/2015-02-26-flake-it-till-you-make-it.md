Wildfires are often caused by lightning, and other common causes such as negligence, deliberate arson, volcanic eruptions and pyroclastic clouds, heat waves, droughts and periodic climate shifts such as el nino can dramatically increase the risk of wildfires. The purpose of this capstone project was to demonstrate data visualizing techniques and machine learning methods to predict the causes of wildfire and analysis the wildfire in the States during the 24-year period (1992-2015).
